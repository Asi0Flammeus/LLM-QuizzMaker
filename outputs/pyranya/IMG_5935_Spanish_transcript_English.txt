Hello, good morning, here we are at the beach, if you can introduce yourself through the DescubreBitcoin platform. Hello, my name is Gerardo Morán, I am from Concepción del Taco, we are very far from here, but it is a pleasure to be here, I belong to the Mi Primer Bitcoin team. It has been more than a couple of months since, well since February to be exact, that I have been part of the team and proudly educate people about Bitcoin around El Salvador, at least I came to know what Bitcoin is through the organization of Mi Primer Bitcoin, since they came to investigate.
