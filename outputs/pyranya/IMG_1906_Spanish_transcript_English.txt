Hi Quentin, can you start by introducing yourself a little bit, who you are and all that? My name is Quentin, I am French, as you can see. No, I was going to ask you a little bit about what you do in the Bitcoin universe, maybe you are known on Twitter because you do The Bitcoin Backup. Yeah, basically I work with my first Bitcoins, I work on the Lapierreaya project. Here we educate people about Bitcoin and we are bootstrapping, we are starting the circular economy thanks to Bitcoin. That's why we organized this festival. Today is finally the day we organized this festival and the goal was to bring tourists here, to this beautiful island that is a bit abandoned because the people who live here don't see its potential. So the goal was to attract tourists, show them this island, what it has to offer, and at the same time motivate the locals to use Bitcoin, to know how to use it in order to receive payments in Bitcoin from these tourists. So the objective was twofold and today it has been a real success because a lot of people came, people used Bitcoin, people wanted to learn about Bitcoin, how it works, etc. So we are delighted. That's great. Here, almost all the merchants accepted it during the festival. What do you think about the adoption of Bitcoin in general in El Salvador, beyond the island of Piraeus? It's interesting, I think at first they really wanted to be interested in the subject and then there was a peak and then it went down and now I think it's coming back. I think we need to do deep education because Bitcoin is really not an easy topic. Understanding how to use it sovereignly, without trusting a custodial wallet or things like that. So there is really a lot to do and there really needs to be a real economic and personal interest for everyone to decide to use it. So the real challenge is to show them that it's worth it and that it's beneficial for them. Because it's not enough to say Bitcoin is great, it's centralized, all these great adjectives that we know because we are nerds. They don't really know, and it's not just here, it's everywhere actually. It will develop from the moment people really realize and there will be the click of "Ok, I need this". How long have you been in El Salvador? I arrived in August 2022, I stayed for two months, then I went back to Mexico, I came back to adopt Bitcoin, I went back to Mexico, I came back to Piraeus and I've been here for three months now. You answered a little bit, but you also do The Bitcoin Backup, right? Yes. And can you explain to us what it serves in Piraeus? Actually, just before coming here to El Salvador, I was in Mexico working on this personal project, I want to do Bitcoin coaching for all these people who are not technical, who either don't have the time, the energy, or the technical means to be interested in Bitcoin and really use this tool as it should be used, so that they can use Bitcoin like we use it as Bitcoin nerds, so that our parents can use Bitcoin. So I want to do coaching for these people who have this attraction to freedom, to sovereignty, especially since everything that has happened since 2019-2021, but who are not comfortable enough or who don't feel comfortable enough to use Bitcoin on their own and who will need something. So that's really what I'm trying to do. Since I've been in Piraeus, I haven't had much time to really work on all the marketing aspect, finding clients, etc. But yes, that's what I do. Does what you do target a specific geography? No, the goal is to build a Bitcoin strategy that is valid in the long term because we can make strategies, make plans and then if you're not technical, you make a Bitcoin strategy and then in 5 years you've lost your private key. So if we really want to do something solid, it has to be robust, it has to be well thought out, it has to be adapted to your family, economic, financial situation, etc. But geographically, it's independent of your country, you can adapt it wherever you are. And since I speak French, English, and Spanish, I think I can adapt it to more or less anything. Okay, that's great. Thank you for this festival since we participated in it, we really enjoyed it and we can't wait to continue to see what you do and see what you will do here in Olaperia but also elsewhere. Thank you Quentin.
